# pytorch-ddpm

Code based on this [article](https://learnopencv.com/denoising-diffusion-probabilistic-models/) from [learnopencv.com](https://learnopencv.com/). Good starting point for learning about DDPMs.

Added a couple of things:
- custom dataset compatibility
- `tests` folder with two simple scripts to check model memorization
- sampling directory in base configuration
